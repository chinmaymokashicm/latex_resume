I saw your listing of `Senior Machine Learning Engineer, Applied AI' on LinkedIn and I was thrilled to see it because it was exactly the type of job I've been looking for to apply my skills in the healthcare tech industry.

Since I was an undegradate student, my ambition was always to build something cool, something that people would use. I taught myself technical skills in a manner such that I could build a prototype of the product which was already in my head. When I tried to build an automated mercury sphygmomanometer during my undergraduate, I did not have the necessary skills to create it on my own, but my thought process was always from the point-of-view of a user. As a master's student with a few years of experience in industry, I believe I have gained a better perspective now.

I believe if I get an opportunity to work in this position, I would bring in my attitude of taking initiative and sense of ownership. I was impressed on your work on the Proactive Alert Pipeline. This is exactly the kind of work I was aiming to do ever since starting my MS program in Biomedical Informatics. I have previously worked on a similar project at Quantiphi Inc., although that was not in the healthcare domain. 

I look forward to hearing from you.
