I saw your listing of the Data Scientist position and I was thrilled to see it because it was exactly the type of position I've been looking for to apply my skills in data science industry.

Since I was an undergraduate student, my ambition was always to build something cool, something that people would use. I taught myself technical skills in a manner such that I could build a prototype of the product which was already in my head. When I tried to build an automated mercury sphygmomanometer during my undergraduate, I did not have the necessary skills to create it on my own, but my thought process was always from the point-of-view of a user. As a master's student with a few years of experience in industry, I believe I have gained a better perspective now.

Over the years, I have grown as a professional who can build prototypes of data science applications with skills in almost every aspect of a data science pipeline. I pre-process and process data, build pipelines, analyze data and build machine learning models. I also have experience in building data and API architecture and automation.

I believe that this position would be the perfect way for me to re-enter the industry after my Master's. 

I look forward to hearing from you.
